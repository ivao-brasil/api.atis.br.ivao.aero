# IVAO Brazil ATIS Generator

The main purpose of this project is to allow pilots and ATCs members of IVAO to easily get access to an accurate and realistic ATIS service. Moreover, it allows division staff members to edit the rules for each runway on each airport via an admin portal. Therefore the staffs have the control of how each runway will behave on each condition and the pilots and ATCs will have this information online and syncronized with the current METAR of each airport.
